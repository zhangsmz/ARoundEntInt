# Project Startup Guide  
  
Hi! This project combines a frontend built with a modern JavaScript framework (like React,  etc. depending on the `frontend` folder content) and a backend developed using Node.js. Below is a detailed startup guide to help you quickly get up and running with the project.  
  
## Prerequisites  
  
1. **Node.js**: Ensure that Node.js is installed on your development environment. You can download and install it from the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).  
  
## Frontend Project Startup  
  
### 1. Navigate to the Frontend Directory  
  
First, open a terminal (or command prompt) and navigate to the `frontend` directory within the `StarterCode` folder:  
  
```bash  
cd /StarterCode/frontend
```

### 2. Install Dependencies 
  
Within the frontend directory, execute the following command to install all necessary dependencies for the frontend project:
```bash
npm i
```


### 3. Start the Frontend Project

Once the dependencies are installed, execute the following command to start the frontend project:
```bash
npm run start
```

## Backend Project Startup 
  
### 1. Navigate to the Backend Directory  
  
In a separate terminal window (or command prompt), navigate to the backend directory within the StarterCode folder: 
  
```bash  
cd /StarterCode/backend

```

### 2. Install Dependencies 
  
Within the backend directory, run the following command to install all the necessary dependencies for the backend project:
```bash
npm i
```


### 3. Start the Backend Service

After the dependencies are installed, run the following command to start the backend service:
```bash
node index.js
```
